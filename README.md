 
Create a full stack Django application with the following features.
 
It should be a search application like google that enables people to search for an app and see all the reviews.
 
The search should be based on algorithm for text similarity. Upon typing the first 3 characters the user should get suggestions. Upon hitting enter the user should get a list of results. Each result would have data from googlestore.csv. Upon click it should show the list of reviews from the googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv.
 
The user should be able to create a new review and send it for approval to his supervisor
 
A second user(i.e. supervisor) should be able to login and see all the reviews for approval and have the ability to approve this.
 
Please find attached a dataset downloaded from Kaggle that has details from the google play store apps.
